## [JBA-Py] Project: Loan Calculator

I start this project to focus on learning to implement CLI arguments with Python.  I was stuck for a while at the 'Duplicate File Handler' project, which requires both the `os` and `argparse` modules.  I was not prepared for both so I want to take a step down in complexity and focus only on the `argparse` module.  This project will help me achieve practical experience in using `argparse`.

"Go back to the basics if you are stuck!"


### Project Description
Personal finances are an important part of life.  Sometimes you need some extra money and decide to take a loan, or you want to buy a house using a mortgage.  To make an informed decision, you need to be able to calculate different financial parameters.  Let's make a program that can help us with that!


### Learning Outcomes
I will practice using math and Python for everyday tasks, and more importantly how to use third-party modules and libraries (`argparse` in particular).  I will also learn about different financial instruments.
